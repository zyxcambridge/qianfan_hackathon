i love openai, and everything iâ€™ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together. when i decided to join msft on sun evening, it was clear that was the best path for me and the team. with the new board and w satyaâ€™s support, iâ€™mâ€¦

satya and my top priority remains to ensure openai continues to thrive

we are committed to fully providing continuity of operations to our partners and customers

the openai/microsoft partnership makes this very doable

sam said
we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. 

we are all going to work together some way or other, and iâ€™m so excited. 

one team, one mission.

the openai leadership team, particularly mira brad and jason but really all of them, have been doing an incredible job through this that will be in the history books. 

incredibly proud of them.

i love the openai team so much
sam said
if i start going off, the openai board should go after me for the full value of my shares
sam said
i love you all. 

today was a weird experience in many ways. but one unexpected one is that it has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while youâ€™re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome.

one takeaway: go tell your friends how great you think they are.

i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people.

will have more to say about whatâ€™s next later.

there is a new version of GPT-4 Turbo now live in ChatGPT; you should hopefully find it a lot better!

please let us know what you think.
GPTs can save a lot of effort:
sam said
GPTs are now live for all ChatGPT+ subscribers!
sam said
usage of our new features from devday is far outpacing our expectations. 

we were planning to go live with GPTs for all subscribers monday but still havenâ€™t been able to. we are hoping to soon. 

there will likely be service instability in the short term due to load. sorry :

there are some great parts about the AI EO, but as the govt implements it, it will be important not to slow down innovation by smaller companies/research teams.

i am pro-regulation on frontier systems, which is what openai has been calling for, and against regulatory capture.
sam said
(there is nuance in saying "regulate us, but not smaller competitors" that somehow ends up getting lost and we just get bashed, but i think it's important enough to be worth it
